# Crowdfunding-Analytics
Analysis of Crowd Funding Campaigns of Giva

# Objectives:
Analyze the Kiva.org lending platform. Understand how much money has been borrowed, for what purpose, and where the borrowers live.


In particular, we want to answer the following groups of questions:

How much money has been borrowed through Kiva's lending platform? How has the amount of funding changed over time?
How much funding has been provided by category (theme)?
How does funding vary by world region? What are the most popular themes in each region?
